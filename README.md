# Exp 03- RAILWAY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

# AIM:

To develop the Online Ticket Reservation System using Star UML tool.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

## Step 1: Problem Identification

Manual railway operations such as ticket booking, train scheduling, and passenger management are slow and error-prone. The system aims to automate these processes for efficiency and accuracy.

## Step 2: Requirement Analysis

Users: Passenger, Admin, and Booking Clerk.  
Main Functions: Train schedule management, ticket booking/cancellation, seat availability check, fare calculation, and report generation.  
Non-Functional Needs: High reliability, data security, and user-friendly interface.    

## Step 3: System Design

Draw UML diagrams: Use Case, Class, Activity, Sequence, Communication, and Package diagrams.    
Create database tables for Trains, Passengers, Tickets, and Schedules.
